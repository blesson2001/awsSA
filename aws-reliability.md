AWS reliability:-

High availability:-

Minimize outage, recover quickly

The high availabilty is does is respond when there is a failure and fix that failure quickly. So that system can be brought back into service.

Fault tolarance:-
This is the ability of a system to operate through failures

Using load balancers

Disaster recovery:-

This is the plan or what we need to do in the event of a Disaster

Recover when high availabilty and fault tolarance will do not work.

this need preplaning we have to store a backup else where in another region.
